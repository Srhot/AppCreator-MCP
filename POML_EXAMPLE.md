# POML (Project Orchestration Markup Language) Examples

POML is AppCreator's project manifest format. It provides a human-readable representation of project state, progress, and orchestration details.

## Basic POML Structure

```toml
# POML - Project Orchestration Markup Language
# Generated by AppCreator AI Software Factory

[project]
name = "example-app"
type = "web"
tech_stack = "react-typescript"
description = "An example web application"
created_at = "2025-01-17T10:30:00.000Z"
status = "active"

[progress]
total_tasks = 25
completed_tasks = 10
current_phase = "development"
progress_percentage = 40.00%

[features]
feature_1 = "user-authentication"
feature_2 = "dashboard"
feature_3 = "api-integration"
feature_4 = "real-time-updates"

[next_steps]
step_1 = "Install project dependencies"
step_2 = "Configure development environment"
step_3 = "Implement core features"
step_4 = "Write tests"

[auto_refresh]
# Use 'auto_refresh' tool to save state and prevent context loss
# This ensures seamless continuation of work across sessions

[context]
# AppCreator maintains project context automatically
# State is saved in .appcreator/state.json
# POML file serves as human-readable project manifest
```

## POML Sections Explained

### [project]
Core project metadata:
- `name`: Project identifier
- `type`: Project category (web, api, cli, desktop, mobile, library)
- `tech_stack`: Technology stack used
- `description`: Brief project description
- `created_at`: ISO timestamp of creation
- `status`: Current status (initializing, active, completed, paused)

### [progress]
Progress tracking:
- `total_tasks`: Total number of tasks
- `completed_tasks`: Number of completed tasks
- `current_phase`: Current development phase
- `progress_percentage`: Completion percentage

### [features]
List of features being implemented. Each feature automatically adds tasks to the total count.

### [next_steps]
Ordered list of immediate next actions. Updated dynamically as project progresses.

### [auto_refresh]
Information about auto-refresh usage and state management.

### [context]
Context preservation details and state file locations.

### Custom Sections
You can add custom sections based on project type:
- `[dependencies]`: Project dependencies
- `[endpoints]`: API endpoints (for API projects)
- `[commands]`: CLI commands (for CLI projects)
- `[screens]`: App screens (for mobile/desktop projects)
- `[platforms]`: Platform support status

## Using POML Files

### Reading POML
POML files are human-readable. Open them in any text editor to:
- Check project status
- Review progress
- See next steps
- Understand feature scope

### Updating POML
POML files are auto-generated by AppCreator but can be:
1. **Auto-updated**: Use `generate_poml` tool
2. **Manually edited**: Edit the file directly (be careful with format)
3. **Version controlled**: Commit to git for tracking changes

### Best Practices
1. **Keep Updated**: Regenerate after major changes
2. **Version Control**: Commit POML with code changes
3. **Use as Reference**: Share with team members
4. **Track Progress**: Review regularly during development
5. **Customize**: Add project-specific sections as needed

## POML vs State File

| Aspect | POML | .appcreator/state.json |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| Format | TOML (human-readable) | JSON (machine-readable) |
| Purpose | Project manifest | Internal state storage |
| Updated | On demand or manually | Automatically |
| Version Control | Yes, commit to git | No, add to .gitignore |
| Editing | Safe to edit | Don't edit manually |
| Audience | Developers, team | AppCreator internal |

## Integration with Auto-Refresh

When using auto-refresh:

1. **State Saved**: Complete state → `.appcreator/state.json`
2. **POML Updated**: Human-readable manifest → `PROJECT.poml`
3. **Continuation Generated**: Resume prompt created
4. **Context Preserved**: Full context maintained

Example workflow:
```
1. Work on project
2. Before context limit: use auto_refresh
3. AppCreator saves state + updates POML
4. Start new session with continuation prompt
5. Load state seamlessly
6. Continue where you left off
```

POML makes your projects transparent, trackable, and easy to manage!
